Grab_names is a simple python script that helps you copy the names of files of any format, and paste them into a file it create by the name you gave it.
it may come in handy when dealing with an large file and you need to copy the name of every one of them.

if you need the code or you are on linux like me just download the grab_names.py, if you are on windows just download the application which is grab_names.exe .....
if you want to improve it just fork the repo and create a pull request....
